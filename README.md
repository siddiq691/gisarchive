Data Scraping and Satellite Imaging

This project is designed for efficient data scraping and satellite imaging processing. It collects and processes large-scale geospatial data from online sources, integrates satellite imagery, and performs analytical operations.

Features
Web Scraping: Extracts structured and unstructured data from relevant sources.
Satellite Image Processing: Downloads and processes satellite images for analysis.
Automation: Scheduled scraping and image retrieval for continuous data collection.
Data Cleaning & Storage: Formats and stores collected data efficiently.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
BeautifulSoup & Scrapy: For web scraping.
Selenium: For handling dynamic content.
OpenCV & GDAL: For satellite image processing.
Pandas & NumPy: For data handling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualization.

Usage
Modify the configuration file to specify:
URLs for data scraping.
Image sources and processing options.
Output format and storage locations.

Future Enhancements
Machine Learning Integration: For image classification.
Cloud Storage Support: For large-scale data handling.
Real-time Scraping: Using APIs for live data updates.
